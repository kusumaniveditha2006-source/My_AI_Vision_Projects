I just built an AI that can recognize pictures like cats, dogs, and airplanes! 🐱✈️ Using Python and TensorFlow in Google Colab, I trained two models: a custom CNN (63.99% accuracy) and a smarter MobileNetV2 (31.78% accuracy). Check out my project on GitHub: [https://github.com/kusumaniveditha2006-source/My_AI_Vision_Projects]! So excited to learn about AI and computer vision! 🚀 #AI #MachineLearning #ComputerVision
