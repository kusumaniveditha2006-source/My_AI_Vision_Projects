# My AI Vision Project
This is my cool AI that can guess pictures like cats, dogs, and airplanes! I built it using Python and TensorFlow in Google Colab. It uses two models: a custom CNN and a smarter MobileNetV2. Check out my code, models, and demo image!

## What I Did
- Loaded the CIFAR-10 dataset with 50,000 pictures.
- Built and trained a CNN model to guess pictures.
- Used MobileNetV2 for a smarter AI.
- Made charts to show how my AI learned.
- Created a demo to show my AI guessing a picture.

## Files
- `My_AI_Vision_Project.ipynb`: My code notebook.
- `my_ai_model.h5`: My first AI brain.
- `my_smart_ai_model.h5`: My smarter AI brain.
- `demo_image.png`: A picture my AI guessed.

## Results
My first AI got about 69.33% accuracy
My smarter AI got about  31.78% accuracy# My_AI_Vision_Projects
"My AI that sees pictures!"
